    This method must evaluate all possible moves from all pieces of the current color.

    So if minMaxArg.playAsWhite is True, all possible moves of all white pieces must be evaluated.
    And if minMaxArg.playAsWhite is False, all possible moves of all black pieces must be evaluated.

    Iterate over all cells with pieces on them by calling the :py:meth:`iterate_cells_with_pieces <board.Board.iterate_cells_with_pieces>` method.
    For each piece, retrieve all valid moves by calling the :py:meth:`get_valid_cells <pieces.Piece.get_valid_cells>` method of that piece.

    In order to evaluate a valid move, first you need to place that piece on the respective cell. Call the :py:meth:`set_cell <board.BoardBase.set_cell>` method
    to do so. Before doing so, remember the cell the piece is currently placed on as you will need to place it back later.
    Because placing a piece on a new cell could potential hit (and thus remove) an opposing piece currently placed on this cell,
    you need to remember the piece on the target cell as well. Call :py:meth:`get_cell <board.BoardBase.get_cell>` to retrieve that piece and store it in a variable.

    After the new board configuration is set in place, call the :py:meth:`evaluate <board.Board.evaluate>` method. You can use the
    :py:class:`Move` class to store the move (piece and target cell) alongside its achieved evaluation score in a list.

    Restore the original board configuration by placing the piece in its original cell and restoring any potentially removed piece before
    moving on to the next move or piece.

    Remember the :py:meth:`evaluate <board.Board.evaluate>` method always evaluates from WHITEs perspective, so a higher evaluation
    relates to a better position for WHITE.

    Moves must be sorted with respect o the scalar evaluation according to the minMax scheme.
    So if minMaxArg.playAsWhite is True, the moves must be sorted in *descending* order, so the best evaluated move for white is in array position 0.
    So if minMaxArg.playAsWhite is False, the moves must be sorted in *ascending* order, so the worst evaluated move for white is in array position 0.

    Use the lists sort method and provide a proper key to the sorting algorithm, such that it sorts the moves according to the achieved score.

    After sorting, a maximum number of moves as provided by the respective parameter must be returned. If there are
    more moves possible (in most situations there are), only return the top (or worst). Hint: Slice the list after sorting.

    **TODO**:
    This method implement the core mini-max search algorithm.
    The minMaxArg contain information about whether we are currently
    playing as white or black as well as the remaining search depth.

    If minMaxArg.depth equals 1, no additional moves will be considered and
    the best evaluated move for the current board configuration should be
    returned. If, however, minMaxArg.depth is greater than 1, for each possible
    move of the current color, all answering moves of the opposite color need
    to be considered.

    *HINT*: Start by calling :py:func:`evaluate_all_possible_moves <engine.evaluate_all_possible_moves>`
    with the provided board and minMaxArg in order to receive a list of evaluated moves.
    Note that the list is already sorted and contains only the best possible moves for the current color.
    This means if white is playing, the returned list will contain the best moves for white to make
    whereas if black is playing, the returned list will contain the best moves for black to make first.

    You will need to handle the special case that there are no possible moves left,
    meaning the :py:func:`evaluate_all_possible_moves <engine.evaluate_all_possible_moves>`
    method returns an empty list. If there are no possible moves left, this means
    the current color has lost the game. Indicate that by returning an instance of the
    :py:class:`Move` class where you set the score attribute to a very high or very low value
    (remember: Always think from whites perspective!)

    If the remaining search depth is greater than 1 (minMaxArg.depth > 1),
    iterate over all possible moves. Implement each move by placing the piece in question on the respective cell.
    Call the :py:meth:`set_cell <board.BoardBase.set_cell>` method
    to do so. Before doing so, remember the cell the piece is currently placed on as you will need to place it back later.
    Because placing a piece on a new cell could potential hit (and thus remove) an opposing piece currently placed on this cell,
    you need to remember the piece on the target cell as well. Call :py:meth:`get_cell <board.BoardBase.get_cell>`
    to retrieve that piece and store it in a variable.

    After the new board configuration is set in place,
    call the :py:meth:`minMax_cached <engine.minMax_cached>` method
    with the next minMaxArg (call :py:meth:`next <engine.MinMaxArg.next>`)

    Overwrite the current moves score with the result from the recursive call.

    Restore the original board configuration by placing the piece in its original cell and restoring any potentially removed piece before
    moving on to the next move.

    After all moves and their counter-moves have been evaluated sort the list
    again in the correct order according to the (new) scores. If playing as white
    (minMaxArg.playAsWhite == True), you need to sort in descending order (highest ranked move first)
    whereas if playing as black (minMaxArg.playAsBlack == False), you need to sort
    in ascending order (lowest ranked move first). Use the lists sort method and
    define a proper key function to implement the needed search.

    In the most basic implementation of the algorithm return the best move after sorting.

    **NOTE**: You can improve the replayability of your chess engine a bit
    if you add some randomness to the evaluation of moves. For example, you
    can randomly increment and decrement each evaluation score. Alternatively
    you can return a random move out of the best three instead of simply the best one.

    Feel free to experiment with this once you have the core algorithm properly implemented.
